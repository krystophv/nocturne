/// <summary>
/// The upstream fingerprints the writes under way belong to, keyed by legacy id. While a scope is
/// open, every save of an <see cref="IUpstreamFingerprinted"/> row whose legacy id it names writes
/// that fingerprint in the same statement, null included. A row the scope does not name keeps its
/// fingerprint.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Ambient rather than passed, because the rows are written by the repositories a decomposer calls,
/// each on a context of its own. Two rules open one. A connector publish names the fingerprint of
/// each treatment it hands over. A treatment decomposed with no scope open, which is another uploader
/// restating the record through the v1 API, names null: the connector then takes the record as it
/// stands as its new baseline rather than overwriting it. Every other write (a v4 edit, a sweep)
/// opens none, so an edit made in Nocturne keeps the fingerprint and survives until the source
/// changes the record.
